### Fitness Dashboard App

__Overview:__ This app allows the user to upload their activity data as a simple Excel .csv file with specified mandatory columns and instantly return interesting information about their activities.

__Purpose:__ To inform users of their progress, insights into their performance and overall metrics about how much distance they have covered, elevation they have climbed and time they have spent doing what they love. The dashboard also contains a model that uses regression to predict future metrics.
